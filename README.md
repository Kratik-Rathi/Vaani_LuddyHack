## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kratik-Rathi/Vaani_LuddyHack.git
cd Vaani_LuddyHack
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
```

> 🔐 You may also need other authentication (e.g., for PyAnnote or WhisperX if using hosted models). Include those as needed.

⚠️ **Do not commit your `.env` file**. It contains sensitive keys.

### 5. Launch the App

```bash
python app.py
```

> Gradio will open a local web app in your browser. Start using Vaani immediately!
